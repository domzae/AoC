## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).
Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight
(EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Advent of Code 2021 Story

You're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

Before you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is), and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's a little meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 stars.

Your instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Context

**Done during [Le Wagon x AoC challenge](http://lewagon-aoc.herokuapp.com/)**

**These were not written as example of clean or efficient code** most were done as quickly as possible. Some are much more documented, probably because I wanted to share my code and needed it to be more readable!

## Running the code

Each day is simply in notebooks, and all cells should be runnable from top to bottom, and inputs are provided in the relavent folders. ðŸ™Œ
